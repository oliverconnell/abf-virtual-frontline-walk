            <h4>16th Battalion Canadian Scottish, Canadian Expeditionary Force</h4>
			 <p>Born 21st December 1892, Private William Johnstone Milne VC was an extremely brave man who twice used grenades to stop German machine gun crews from firing on his compatriates. Sadly, he was known to have been killed by enemy shortly after these brave actions which saved numerous men, and in the activity that followed, his body was lost. This was close to where the Vimy Ridge Memorial now stands.</p><p>The following citation was published in the London Gazette on 8th June 1917:</p><p><i>'For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty in attack. On approaching the first objective, Pte. Milne observed an enemy machine gun firing on our advancing troops. Crawling on hands and knees, he succeeded in reaching the gun, killing the crew with bombs, and capturing the gun. On the line re-forming, he again located a machine gun in the support line, and stalking the second gun as he had done the first, he succeeded in putting the crew out of action and capturing the gun. His wonderful bravery and resource on these two occasions undoubtedly saved the lives of many of his comrades. Pte. Milne was killed shortly after capturing the second gun.'</i></p>
